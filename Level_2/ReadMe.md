HTML is the tool used to build the structure of a website. It tells the browser what is a heading, a paragraph, or an image.

div vs. Semantic Tags
<div>: A plain box with no meaning. It is used just to group things together.

Semantic Tags: Boxes with labels (like <header> or <footer>). They tell the browser exactly what the content is, which helps with search results and accessibility.
