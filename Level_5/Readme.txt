What the project does? 
This project is a functional web application designed to help users organize their daily tasks. It allows you to input a task, add it to a list, and visually manage your goals for the day by deleting items as they are completed.

What I'm proud of?
I am proud of the clean and organized structure I created using HTML and CSS. I successfully designed a user-friendly interface that looks modern and remains responsive. Getting the "Add Task" button to visually interact with the list was a satisfying accomplishment in bridging the gap between a static design and a functional tool.

What I still don't understand?
I am still finding JavaScript logic quite challenging, especially regarding how to handle multiple events and data storage. While the app works, I don't yet fully grasp how the functions communicate with each other or how to use advanced concepts like arrays to keep the list organized in the code. I am also working to understand how to prevent the data from disappearing when the page is refreshed.
