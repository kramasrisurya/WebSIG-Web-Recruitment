Git 
Git is a computer tool that remembers all the changes you make to files on the computer. Git helps save different versions so that you can return to a previous version if you make a mistake while working on a file. It operates offline and is only on the computer.

GitHub 
GitHub is a web platform that holds your Git projects. It is a cloud backup system where you can share your projects with other users. You utilize the platform to link different computers or collaborate with others on a project.

Folder on your computer:
A regular folder only retains the latest copy of any file. If you save an edit or erase an item, the previous version is lost forever. It doesn't remember the past.

Git Repository: 
It is a directory that "remembers." It keeps a record of every change made in every file hosted in it. It is able to show you every change made in your own work and revert it back to any point in history.

GitHub repository:
This is the online version of your project. It holds the same history as your Git folder but lives on the internet. This makes your work safe if your computer breaks and allows other people to see or help with your code.

Why developers use it?

1.Safety:
 They could also mess up a project by breaking it. They could instantly repair it by reverting to a version of their work that was  functional. It is a perpetual "Undo" button on their entire work.
2.Teamwork:
Many people are able to work on the same files simultaneously. The software combines all of their modifications automatically while also making sure that nothing is deleted from each other's files.
3.Tracking Progress:
 This versioning system maintains an “historical” record of who made what changes and when these were made. This makes it easy to track the evolution of the project and the rationale underlying various decisions.
4.Remote Access:
 Because the code is located online, developers have access to it from any computer and always have access to the newest copy of their files.
