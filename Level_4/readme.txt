JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to create dynamic and interactive content on websites. It allows the browser to respond to user actions and process data.


HTML is the structure of the web page. It defines the basic layout and organization of elements like headings, paragraphs, and images.

CSS is the presentation or styling. It is used to control the visual appearance, including colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive layouts.

JS is the behavior and logic. It makes the static structure and style come alive by handling events and changing content based on user input.
